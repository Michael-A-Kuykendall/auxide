# Auxide v0.1.0

- Initial release: Graph → Plan → Runtime architecture.
- RT-safe block processing (no allocs/locks in hot paths) and deterministic execution.
- Invariants: single-writer, no cycles, rate compatibility.
- Minimal DSP nodes: SineOsc, Gain, Mix, OutputSink.
- PPT system and correctness hardening (block size, edge directions, bounds, phase wrapping).
